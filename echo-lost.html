                    <h3>Summary</h3>
                    <p>
                        Koko is a small bat-like creature that cannot see
                        and is trapped in a cave. To make up for this,
                        they are able to use echolocation to understand their
                        surroundings, which is visually represented in the
                        game by platforms briefly lighting up when there is
                        sound. The player must help Koko get to the end of
                        each level to escape the cave.

                        Echo Lost was made for Global Game Jam 2021 with the theme of Lost and Found.

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            This was my first game in Unity, so it was a great opportunity for me to get a feel for the editor
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            This was also my first game jam, and I learned how important planning with a realistic scope is. We had to priortize what we needed in the game and focus on that.
