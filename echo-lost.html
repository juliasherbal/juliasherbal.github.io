		<p>
			Koko is a small bat-like creature that cannot see
			and is trapped in a cave. To make up for this, 
			they are able to use echolocation to understand their 
			surroundings, which is visually represented in the 
			game by platforms briefly lighting up when there is 
			sound. The player must help Koko get to the end of 
			each level to escape the cave.
