                    <h3>Summary</h3>
                    <p>
                        After cats have inevitably taken over the world, you are forced to run a cafe for cats!
                        Try your best to keep up with the cat-o-strophic chaos as you manage orders, take tips,
                        and grow your cafe!

                        Our game is a time management cafe sim where you are in charge of managing customers and handling 
                        their orders and tips. What sets it apart from other games in this genre is the variety of 
                        customer types to make each day feel differe. Each type of customer will have its own levels of
                        patience, speed, and tip price range.
                        
                        variability in what could happen each day in the game as each customer has different 
                        levels of patience, speed, and tips.

                            Made the game feel more responsive by adding polish such as the "goal reached" animation, closed sign falling and bouncing, objects
                            bouncing upon being tapped, paw print particles when pressing menu buttons, and cats meowing in different pitches when tapped
